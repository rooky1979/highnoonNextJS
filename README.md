Static website created with NextJS for a 12 step support group in Las Vegas that share by choosing a topic and then sharing on that topic.

The groups name is The Las Vegas High Noon Gamble so the inspiration was casino's and the bright lights of the Vegas Strip.

The host of the meeting needs a one-stop shop and quick access to tools, readings and items that need to be posted in chat, therefore an idea of a dashboard came to mind. A central hub for everything needed to help make the meeting run more smoothly.
