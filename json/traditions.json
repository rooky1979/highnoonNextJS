        "text3": "3. The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.\n\n",
        
        "text4": "4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or A.A. as a whole.\n\n",

        "text11": "11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.\n\n",
        
        "text12": "12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities."
